# Quote Generator

Quote Generator is my first web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It generates random quotes at the click of a button.

## ✨ What’s Inside?
- 📚 **Random Quotes**: Displays a new quote with each click of the button.
- ⚡ **Built using JavaScript**: JavaScript enables the app to fetch and display quotes dynamically.

## 💡 **Why I Built It**
This project was a great way to improve my JavaScript skills and put them into practice.

## 📸 **Preview**
Here’s a sneak peek of the project:
